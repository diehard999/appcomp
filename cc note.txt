Study all tutorial 
T1
Study all positive point and negative point of cloud computing 
T2
Front end and back end 
T3 
Server virtualization
Conversation web service (old method of web service to web hosting )
Cloud computing (new method to manage web)
Thin and thick client
 cloud computing vs web service (lecture 5-6pass, cc virtual,webservice-physical)
cloud application built collection of component 
-composability (use composasbility system to assembly for certain purpose)
choose cpu/processing power , hard disk size  ,network interface (all these are component)

advantage of cc for this kind of set up
-try to replace employee pc using thin client pc (1)low spec pc but it go to your server) [2]need to improve bandwidth] [3 proper way to disposal the pc]

advantage risk  management 
-cloud vendor help you prevent risk (tutoral got mention
stragegy plan to migrate the cc -(define ,analyze ,approve,charter) lecture 10 strategy plan

paas topic/chapter
-functions to support developer provided by paas( ide,i.service,stability, instrumentation , workflow facilities,ui,visualization tools,collaboration service , source code)

constrainst(disadv)
-language and run-times limitation 
-not all language/library are enabled
-generic apis replace some feature ( may stack with your program ,may face problem in your program
-Size constraints on individual request
-statelessness

lecture 11 risk management
-identity static and speculative risk
-potential benefit(speculative), potential loss (static risk)

-know why classifying and evaluating risk (to come out back up plan and minimized damage )

lecture 7-8 Saas
-reason to apply this service
-adv (requirement can direct meet customer need , lowest cost solution)
-Disadv- problem of customization, indeed to develop additional applications much better with two other service

lect 12 financial impact
Resource cost
-study all workload (like static workload [learn all diagram])
-periodic workload (use for less workload situation ,use recourse for only part of time/rarely but need pay full cost)

last chapter lect 13 security 
-study how to stay safe
-hire expects (4 category [ recognized auditors,organization,legal counsel, experts from general public]

differences of traditional programming and cc
-parallel programming use additional threads (traditional
-allow program scale up itself to server(cc programming
